## Usage
##### Using Default Saved Device
`$ pods`

AirPodsPair will connect to last device that has been paired. AirPodsPair uses UserDefaults to save the last known airpods display name that has been paired successfully in the past and if no arguments are given.

##### On First Connection
`$ pods <substring of airpods display name>`

ex. `$ pods joes`

#### - f 
This will manually flush the last saved device.
This also can be accomplished by over writing the last saved device by providing an display name as an argument. 

`pods -f` **or** `pods joes`

#### - l
This will list the display name for any device that as been successfully pair via bluetooth at least once (assumes device wasn't removed from the device list).

## Other Possible Use Cases
* Can be used inside Automator
    * Automatically connect your airpods when Spotify is opened 
* Can be used in in AppleScript
