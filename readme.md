# Pods
not to be confused with `pod` or cocoa-pods
> Executable that can be used in the terminal or in automation tasks that will attempt to make a bluetooth connection to your AirPods or really any device :)

AirPods automatically connect to their last connected device. For me that is 9/10 always my Iphone, so this project finds its use cases as an executable for automated tasks and as a nice convenience if your already coding.

## Usage
##### Using Default Saved Device
`$ pods`

Pods will connect to last device that has been paired. Pods uses UserDefaults to save the last known AirPods display name that has been paired successfully in the past and if no arguments are given.

##### On First Connection
`$ pods <substring of airpods display name>`

ex. `$ pods joes`

#### - f 
This will manually flush the last saved device.
This also can be accomplished by over writing the last saved device by providing a display name as an argument. 

`pods -f` **or** `pods joes`

#### - l
This will list the display name for any device that as been successfully pair via bluetooth at least once (assumes device wasn't removed from the device list).

## Other Possible Use Cases
* Can be used inside Automator
    * Automatically connect your airpods when Spotify is opened 
* Can be used in in AppleScript

## Installation 

clone the project and place the `pods` executable in `/usr/local/bin` and your off ðŸš€
